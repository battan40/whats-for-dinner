## What's For Dinner? - A Deluge of Information and Learning


## Learning Goals:

  * Understand what it means to write a comp
  * Write a comp
  * Integrate the use of CSS, HTML, and javaScript
  * Be able to understand/describe what each code is doing
  * To discover all the exciting things that I was previously unaware of on the way to learning the basics of CSS and HTML (with some vanilla JS)
  * Primarily work alone even when stuck to truly grasp material and how to find answers needed in the future
  * To be able to use the work, both completion of functionality and code quality.
  * Reach iteration 0 and 1 other feature with full functionality by 9pm Sunday night
  * Manipulate the page after it has loaded, by adding, removing and updating elements of the DOM

## Overview:

Sometimes all we need is a little nudge into the kitchen. This project is to build an app that helps users choose a recipe and put together meals.

This is a Solo Challenge.  I hope my instructors gain the opportunity to get a pulse on where I am with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. I see this as an opportunity to challenge myself and work completely independently.

Google official pages, text books, you-tube were all encouraged and used. No other code base was referenced. This project will determine where I stand and if I am behind at this point in the module.  If necessary the instructors will be able to provide supports to intervene as needed.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/dinner.html).

##Functionality Goal:

* To match as best as possible my CSS, HTML to the provided comp
* When a user selects a dish option and clicks lets cook button the user sees a random dish from the list of possible dishes for that category
* When the dish name appears, the cookpot icon disappears
* Once the above goals are reached, allow the functionality of the `Entire Meal` option.  So, that when the user selects entire meal and clicks `Let's Cook!` the user sees a randomly generated side, main and dessert option from the lists I created.
* When the meal items appear, the cookpot icon disappears

## Future Iterations Goals:

* While initial learning goals were slightly exceeded there's PLENTY of room for growth and understanding from form to functionality
* Refactor JS, CSS, and HTML, to be cleaner, dryer and friendlier code for all future references
* I would like to finish the error handling and clear button functionality.
* Bring in the add, save and store a recipe functionality to the page
* Long term learning: I'd love to get the Keyframes and javaScript timeout fucntion going for this to make my page available on an UI


## The Bones
1. javaScript, CSS, and HTML code is written to manipulate the DOM for UI experience
2. A few lines of HTML are given to contribute to this project
3. Terminal, GIT, Atom and Chrome Browser are used to write, save, and test the app
4. To access the page click this link here:

5. To test the app's functionality, navigate to page at above link. Then click buttons and check pages bugs.
